The goal of this project is to control an epidemic.  
The control is implemented using a model predictive control algorithm, where the controller calculates the optimal control input based on the appropriate parameters and the given epidemic model.  
The objective of the control and the detailed description of the task are thoroughly discussed in the "Thesis.pdf" Abstract and Introduction chapters.
